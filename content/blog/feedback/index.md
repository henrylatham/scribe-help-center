### What's your dream feature?

We believe that building a great product means building a product that has our customers at the heart of decision-making. We regularly hold calls with customers to try to understand precisely how Scribe can help them, whether it be in building a new writing habit, or overcoming anxiety.

As such, we are always open to new ideas - however crazy they may sound - and believe that the best ideas come from gathering a lot of feedback from a diverse group of people.

Therefore, if there's something on your wish list - that feature you would LOVE to see built by the Scribe team - please [get in touch](mailto:jonathan@scribeapp.co?Subject=Scribe%20Feature%20Wishlist) with Henry, our Head of Product, with:

1. A brief description of what you would like built  
2. Why you want that feature




### Want to use Scribe for FREE?

If you're willing to help us out even more, we are offering **one month of Scribe for FREE** for anyone that is willing to hop on a call with Henry to just spend 20 minutes talking about:

1. Why you downloaded Scribe?
2. What you like/dislike about it?
3. How Scribe could be improved

If you're interested, just send an email to [request a call & 1 month for free](mailto:jonathan@scribeapp.co?Subject=Scribe%20User%20Call)
