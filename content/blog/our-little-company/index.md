### An Independent, Mission-Driven Team

Scribe isn't owned by some dodgy data-abusing corporation.

It's proudly independent, run by a small founding team of self-help specialists & technical wizards hailing from the UK, Germany, the US & Croatia.

From Day One, we decided we would build this company from the ground up ourselves, without external investment.

That's because external investment inevitably means rapid growth, it means moving away from the interests of our customers - people suffering and looking for an answer - towards serving the interests of investors looking to enrich themselves.

We've worked hard to get where we are:

Taking on demoralising freelance gigs, corporate consultancy and anything else we can find to fund ourselves to continue working on our mission:

Creating more calm minds through Scribe.

-

This model means we need to charge for our products.

We need to protect our interests of our company, and the interests of our customers.

We have a moral obligation to make sure this thing is built to last: That it is profitable so our team can continue to work on, that we can fund growth when and where growth makes sense, to hire the best people possible to help us create impact.

But it also means we remain true to our mission: Helping you.

Helping you reduce anxiety.

Protecting your data.

Investing in improving our ability to help you experience more joy in life and less suffering.
