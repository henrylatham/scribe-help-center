# Seneca

_“Think your way through difficulties: harsh conditions can be softened, restricted ones can be widened, and heavy ones can weigh less on those who know how to bear them.”_

_“Let all your activity be directed to some object, let it have some end in view.”_

_“Often a very old man has no other proof of his long life than his age.”_

_“We say that nothing happens to the wise man against his expectation.”_

_“Believe me it is better to understand the balance-sheet of one’s own life than of the corn trade.”_

_“We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not Ill-supplied but wasteful of it.”_
